### RELAXATION OPTIONS ####
relax:pressure                       	0.0                         # <double>    External pressure (in GPa). If not zero enthalpy is minimized
relax:iteration_limit                	500                         # <int>       Maximal number of iteration of the relax process
relax:mindist                        	1.0                         # <double>    Minimal interatomic distance constraint (in Angstroms)
relax:force_tolerance                	0.0001                      # <double>    Forces on atoms in relaxed configuration should be smaller than this value (in eV/Angstroms). Zero or negative value disables atoms relax (changing fractional coordinates of atoms)
relax:stress_tolerance               	0.001                       # <double>    Stresses in relaxed configuration should be smaller than this value (in GPa). Zero or negative value disables supercell relax (changing lattice vectors of the supercell)               
relax:max_step                       	0.5                         # <double>    Maximal allowed displacement of atoms and lattice vectors in Cartesian coordinates (in Angstroms)
relax:min_step                       	1.0e-8                      # <double>    Minimal displacement of atoms and lattice vectors in Cartesian coordinates (in Angstroms). If allactual displacemnts are lesser than relaxation stops
relax:bfgs_wolfe_c1                  	1.0e-3                      # <double>    Wolfe condition constant on the function decrease (linesearch stopping criterea)
relax:bfgs_wolfe_c2                  	0.7                         # <double>    Wolfe condition constant on the gradient decrease (linesearch stopping criterea)
relax:log                            	out/relaxation.log              # <string>    Where to write relaxation log. No logging if not specified; if "stdout" and "stderr" corresponds to standard output streams; otherwise log will be outputed to file with that name
relax:freeze_small_grads             	FALSE                       # <bool>      Don't move atoms if force is less then force_tolerance  
relax:use_gd_method                  	FALSE                       # <bool>      Use Gradient Descent method instead of BFGS if TRUE
relax:correct_cell                   	FALSE                       # <bool>      Make the lattice more orthogonal (if possible) and lower triangle
relax:init_mindist                   	1.0                         # <double>    Push atoms away from each other (with the pair potential) before relaxation to make minimal interatomic distance larger than this value
relax:forces_elasticity_scale        	10                          # <double>    Initial value for Hessian        
relax:stress_elasticity_scale        	50                          # <double>    Initial value for Hessian
